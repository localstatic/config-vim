Morgan Terry's Vim Configuration
================================

This was originally based on [spf13/spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), but with many things stripped out & other things added. It's diverged a lot since then and may not be recognizable anymore, but I thank spf13 for the inspiration to finally get my vim config in order.

Installation
------------

After installing your vim of choice, the following steps should get you going.

1. Clone this repo to the desired location
2. Run the included `setup.sh`
6. (optional) Install [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) and/or [Powerline version of the "Anonymous Pro"](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/AnonymousPro) fonts
